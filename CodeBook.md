# Samsung Galaxy SII accelerometer and gyroscope tidy data

## Summary
Tidy data set from accelerometer and gyroscope readings from Samsung Galaxy SII smart phones. Participants, wore the smart phone while performing physical activities. Readings were recorded to be used in activity-classification algorithms. This repository does not contain the classification algorith. Instead, it creates two tidy data sets, one with the standard deviation and mean of each measurement mapped to clear activity, and one with the mean of each previous measurement for each subject and activity combination. 


## Raw Data Description

From [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

>It is important to note that what is considered raw data in this repository is actually data that was pre processed as described below. 


>The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.__

>The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.__

**accelerometer-gyroscope-activities.txt:** 
For this data set we pulled only the features that calculated the mean or standard deviation of a particular variable. To make the raw data tidy, we did the following:
1. Combined training and test sets into a single data set for features, subjects, and activites. 
2. Pulled only the features that calculated the mean or standard deviation of a variable.
3. Renamed all of the features using dot notation instead of camel case. Also rplaced dashes with dots and remobed an parentheses in the names. Another option was to create fully-named variables like "fft.body.acceleration.jerk.magnitude.mean". This option would make working with the data difficult, so we stuck with the truncated names as they are still clear while also being concise. 

The resulting file, accelerometer-gyroscope-activities.txt contains one row for every measurement sample. Each subject and activity should have multiple rows of data in the file as measurements were recorded over time. 


activity: Text description of the activity performed during the reading. Possible values are "walking", "walking.upstairs", "walking.downstairs", "sitting", "standing", "laying"
subject: Integer denoting which test subject the reading is from. No text descriptions of the test subject were recorded.

##subject-activity-means.txt
This data set is derived from the data in accelerometer-gyroscope-activities.txt. For each subject/activity combination in the data, we created a single row with the mean of each variable. To make the raw data tidy, we did the following:
1. Melted the data.frame using activity and test.subject as the ID. This gave us a four-column data.frame
2. Summarized the data using dcast() again using activity and test.subject as the id. Each variable was then summarized using the mean of all records meeting each activity/test.subject combination. 
3. Variable names were modified by adding ".mean" at the end. This means we have variables named "*.mean.mean". This should make it very clear that each is reporting the mean of a sumarrized variable.

Each variable in accelerometer-gyroscope-activities.txt should have a corresponding *.mean variable in subject-activity-means.txt
